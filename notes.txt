should come up with like an initialize rule thing
so the config can have certain elements set programatically and vary within a run

load rules automatically from a list of files, rather than importing each
    so each rule script needs to have a func with the same name that gets called?

more rules

example set to training data adapter
save training data
visualize training data

data structure

Rule: describes how to make a set of input output pairs
    has to be a set since some rules operate at the set level!
Example: Input/output of a specific rule
Example Set: a set of input/output pairs 
Training Example Set: an example set with the output pair of the last example cut off to use as a label

speculation + notes

will there be a self-supervised prediction step?
or just go right to the 'supervised' step?
I mean, in a way, training on example sets is like self completion since theyre sequences...


so how do you specify a rule?
a config and a function

then point at the file that contains both
instantiate Role objects from those two
